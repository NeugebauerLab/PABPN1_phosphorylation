# PABPN1 Phosphorylation: RNA-seq analyses

# Preprocessing, mapping, splicing, and poly(A) tail lengths quantification (Long-read Sequencing)

Preprocessing, mapping, splicing, and poly(A) tail lengths quantification can be carried out with the attached Snakemake pipeline. Be sure to create/adjust the sample.yaml file as needed.

# Plotting and correlative analyses

Code for making plots and carrying out statistical and correlative comparisons (e.g. tail length vs. RNA stability) can be found the attached jupyter notebooks. 

Notebooks:
 Alternative polyadenylation
 TimeLapse-seq/RNA stability
 Differential gene expression (from DESeq2, Illumina sequencing)
 Non-A nucleotide usage in poly(A) tails
 Poly(A) tail lengths from all reads
 Poly(A) tail lengths per gene
 Poly(A) tail lengths per splice-isoform
 Readlengths and coverage for LRS data
